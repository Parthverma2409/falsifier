# Falsifier

Falsifier checks model-proposed code patches by running them in isolated sandboxes, and keeps only the findings that execution supports.

## Problem

_TODO: describe the problem Falsifier addresses._

## How it works

_TODO: describe the red, patch, green loop and how evidence is collected._

## Verdicts

_TODO: list the possible verdicts and what each one means._

## Usage

_TODO: installation and CLI usage._

### Configuration

Settings live in `falsifier/config.py`; this list mirrors it.

| Setting | Value | Override |
|---|---|---|
| Token Factory base_url (OpenAI-compatible) | `https://api.tokenfactory.nebius.com/v1/` | `FALSIFIER_BASE_URL` |
| Generation model | `nvidia/Nemotron-3_5-Lightning`, thinking off | `FALSIFIER_MODEL` |
| Model price, USD per 1M tokens in / out | 0.06 / 0.24 | `FALSIFIER_USD_PER_M_INPUT`, `FALSIFIER_USD_PER_M_OUTPUT` |
| Response cache (gitignored) | `.cache/generate/` | `FALSIFIER_GENERATE_CACHE` |
| Sandbox spend ceiling | set per script | `FALSIFIER_SPEND_CEILING_USD` |

`NEBIUS_API_KEY` and `NEBIUS_PROJECT_ID` are read from the environment or a local `.env`; see
`.env.example`.

## Limitations

_TODO: known limitations._

## Prior art

Falsifier is an independent implementation. Three projects shaped the design:

- PatchProof (Apache-2.0) for the red, patch, green loop and per-attempt evidence
- Kelp (MIT) for evidence-gated findings: the model proposes, execution decides
- CodeMore (MIT) for pairing every rule with true-positive and false-positive fixtures

No code was copied from any of them.
